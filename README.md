1.
2.  Write a Java program that works as a simple calculator. Use a grid layout to arrange buttons 
    for the digits and for the +, -, *, % operations. Add a text field to display the result. Handle 
    any possible exceptions like divided by zero.

4.  Write a Java program that creates a user interface to perform integer divisions. The user 
    enters two numbers in the text fields, number 1 and number 2. The division of number 1 
    and number 2 is displayed in the result field when the divide button is clicked. If number 1 or 
    number 2 were not an integer, the program would throw a NumberFormatException. If 
    number 2 were 0, the program would throw an ArithmeticException. Display the exception 
    in the message dialog box. 
5.  Write a Java program that implements multi-thread application that has three threads. First 
    thread generates a random integer every one second, and if the value is even, the second 
    thread computes the square of the number and prints. If the value is odd, the third thread 
    will print the value of the cube of the number.
6.  Write a Java program for the following:  
    1. Create a doubly linked list of elements.  
    2.Delete a given element from the above list.  
    3.Display the contents of the list after deletion.
