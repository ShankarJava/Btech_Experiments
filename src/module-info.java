	 * Write a Java program that works as a simple calculator. Use a grid layout to
	 * arrange buttons for the digits and for the plus minus star percentile
	 * operations. Add a text field to display the result. Handle any possible
	 * exceptions like divided by zero.

	/*
	 * Write a Java program that creates a user interface to perform integer
	 * divisions. The user enters two numbers in the text fields, number 1 and
	 * number 2. The division of number 1 and number 2 is displayed in the result
	 * field when the divide button is clicked. If number 1 or number 2 were not an
	 * integer, the program would throw a NumberFormatException. If number 2 were 0,
	 * the program would throw an ArithmeticException. Display the exception in the
	 * message dialog box.

	/*
	 * Write a Java program that implements multi-thread application that has three
	 * threads. First thread generates a random integer every one second, and if the
	 * value is even, the second thread computes the square of the number and
	 * prints. If the value is odd, the third thread will print the value of the
	 * cube of the number.
